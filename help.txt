Welcome to the profit and loss calculation system!

Available options:

1. Wallet
- Create, update, remove and search for investment wallets.

First, start by creating a wallet, the output will be the ID and status of the operation, save this ID for future operations

2. Transactions
- Record purchases and sales of assets with dates and quantities.
It also allows editing and deletion of Transactions, it works similarly to the wallet, save the ID for future operations

3. Reports
- Consult balances, histories, profit/loss simulations and wallet listings.
It can be used if you need to review the IDs of the wallets, and use them to see the history, thus having access to the IDs of the movement Also

- Gain/Loss is calculated based on the balance and quotation of the day, the value 0 means that your balance has not appreciated
or depreciated, the output is in the American standard, therefore 10.20 means that your balance has appreciated 10.20
